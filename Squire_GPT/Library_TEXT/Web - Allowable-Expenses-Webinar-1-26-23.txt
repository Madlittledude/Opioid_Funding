Review of Janssen &
Distributors (J&D) Settlements

_Page: 5

Overview of Opioid Settlement Funds

» Throughout the opioid overdose epidemic, state, local, and tribal
governments have brought lawsuits against pharmaceutical and
drug distribution companies to recover costs associated with the
epidemic and ensure that future crises are prevented.

» On July 21, 2021, announcements were made regarding proposed
settlements worth up to $26 billion with opioid manufacturer
Janssen and three Distributors (McKesson, Cardinal Health and
AmerisourceBergen) to resolve investigations and litigation related
to the companies’ roles related to the opioid crisis.

_Page: 6

Overview of Opioid Settlement Funds

» California is expected to receive approximately $2.05 billion from the
J&D Settlement Agreements, which will be paid through 2038. The
majority of funds will be provided to Participating Subdivisions to be
used for opioid abatement activities.

» All Janssen & Distributor payments will be made by the national
settlement administrator, BrownGreer PLC.

_Page: 7

OSF Oversight Entity: DHCS

» The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) is tasked with
overseeing Participating Subdivisions that have received funds from
the J&D Settlements.

» DHCS J&D Settlements oversight responsibilities include:

» Monitoring the California Participating Subdivisions for compliance;
» Designating additional high-impact abatement activities;

» Conducting related stakeholder engagement; and

» Preparing annual reports.

Exhibit E

_Page: 10

Exhibit E of the National Settlement
Agreements

» Unlike the Big Tobacco settlements of the 1990's, the opioid settlements
outline the allowable use of opioid remediation funds. Opioid remediation
activities are listed in Exhibit E of the Janssen and Distributors settlements.

» Exhibit E is included in both the Janssen and Distributor settlements and is
broken into Schedule A (Core Strategies) and Schedule B (Approved Uses).
Schedule B is a longer list of many types of opioid remediation activities,
while Schedule A is a shorter list of core strategies that should be
prioritized.

For a list of allowable activities, please refer to the J&D Settlement Allowable Expenditures.

_Page: 11

Schedule A: Core Strategies

» Naloxone or Other FDA-Approved Drug to Reverse Opioid Overdoses

» Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) Distribution and Other Opioid-Related Treatment
» Pregnant and Postpartum Women

» Expanding Treatment for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)

» Expansion Of Warm Hand-Off Programs and Recovery Services

» Treatment for Incarcerated Population

» Prevention Programs

» Expanding Syringe Service Programs

California's High Impact
Abatement Activities

a

_Page: 13

High Impact Abatement Activities

» In addition to the opioid remediation activities outlined within the
settlement agreements, California has designated a set of five High Impact
Abatement Activities (HIAA).

» No less than fifty percent (50%) of the funds received by a California
Participating Subdivision from the Abatement Accounts Fund in each
calendar year will be used for one or more of the HIAA.

» Many activities outlined within Exhibit E can qualify as HIAA depending on
their focus.

HIAA #1: Behavioral Health Continuum
Infrastructure Program

» DHCS was authorized through 2021 legislation to establish the Behavioral Health
Continuum Infrastructure Program (BHCIP) with $2.2 billion to construct, acquire,
and rehabilitate real estate assets or to invest in needed mobile crisis
infrastructure to expand the community continuum of behavioral health
treatment resources.

» DHCS is releasing BHCIP grant funds through six rounds that target various gaps
in the state’s behavioral health facility infrastructure. The BHCIP data dashboard
with more information about how funding has been used can be accessed here.

» Cities and counties can use OSF dollars for matching funds or operating costs for
substance use disorder facilities with an approved BHCIP project.

_Page: 16

BHCIP Funding Rounds 1-3

» Round 1: Crisis Care Mobile Units (CCMU) Program Grant
» Provides funding for California county, city, or tribal entity behavioral
health authorities to implement new and enhanced CCMUs
» Round 2: Behavioral Health County and Tribal Planning Grant

» Provides an opportunity for counties and tribal entities to expand
planning efforts in their communities or regions for the acquisition and
expansion of behavioral health infrastructure statewide.

» Round 3: Launch Ready Grant

» Supports preparation activities to plan for the acquisition and
expansion of behavioral health infrastructure throughout the state.

Modifying HIAA to Add
Naloxone

a

_Page: 19

DHCS Authority to Modify HIAA

» DHCS can add HIAA but not remove HIAA. The California J&D State-
Subdivision Agreements state:

» "The California Department of Health Care Services ("DHCS”) may add
to this list (but not delete from it) by designating additional High
Impact Abatement Activities. DHCS will make reasonable efforts to
consult with stakeholders, including the CA Participating Subdivisions,
before adding additional High Impact Abatement Activities to this list.”

» DHCS would like your input on whether to add purchasing naloxone to
California’s HIAA.

_Page: 20

What is Naloxone?

» Naloxone is a life-saving medication that reverses an opioid
overdose. It works by blocking the opioid receptor sites and
reversing the toxic effects of an overdose. It can be administered by
intranasal spray, intramuscular (into the muscle), subcutaneous
(under the skin), or by intravenous injection.

» There is little to no effect on an individual if opioids are not present
in their system. Naloxone has few known adverse effects and no
potential for abuse.

_Page: 21

Why is Naloxone Important?

» Opioid overdoses are on the rise, and fentanyl is increasingly involved.

» Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is up to 50 times stronger than
heroin

» There were 7,175 opioid-related overdose deaths in California in 2021;
5,961 (or 83%) of these deaths were related to fentanyl

» By comparison, 48% of opioid overdose deaths in 2019 were fentanyl
related

» Having naloxone available when encountering a suspected overdose can
save a life.

_Page: 22

Poll Question

» Should purchasing naloxone be added to California’s High

Impact Abatement Activities?

» A yes vote means: | support adding naloxone to the list of California's
HIAA. This means that Participating Subdivisions would be able to
spend up to 100% of their J&D allocation on purchasing naloxone.

» A no vote means: | do not support adding naloxone to the list of
California's HIAA. This means that Participating Subdivisions would only
be able to spend up to 50% of their J&D allocation on purchasing
naloxone.

Considerations & Resources

_Page: 25

Considerations for Use of J&D Funds

»

Prioritize California's HIAA and strategies listed in Schedule A “Core Strategies” of Exhibit
E. Participating Subdivisions should prioritize evidence-based strategies for prevention,
treatment, harm reduction and recovery.

» Use funds to supplement current efforts in your community. Rather than creating new
programs or supplanting efforts, look for organizations that are already doing this work
in your jurisdiction. Connect with them to learn about their needs.

» Include people with lived experience and individuals working in the community when
planning for use of the funds.

» If you have questions about the use of funds, reach out to DHCS at OSF @dhcs.ca.gov
with a request for technical assistance.

Feedback from Participating
Subdivisions

» DHCS received feedback from Participating Subdivisions during
and after the December 2022 Listening Session requesting
DHCS to review planned local opioid settlement expenditures.

» According to the settlements, DHCS is not required to approve

planned expenditures; however, DHCS is willing to provide
feedback for interested Participating Subdivisions.

_Page: 28

Poll Question

» Would your Subdivision like the opportunity to submit
spending plans for DHCS review and feedback?
» A yes vote means: Your Subdivision would like the

opportunity (but would not be required) to submit a
spending plan to DHCS for review and feedback.

»A no vote means: Your Subdivision would not be interested in
submitting a spending plan to DHCS for review and
feedback.
