(FDA) approved Narcan, a 4 milligram (mg) naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray, for over-the-counter
(O70), nonprescription use on March 29, 2023. This action paves the way forthe live-saving

medication to reverse an opioid overdose to be sold directly to consumers. The timeline for
availabilty and price of the OTC product is determined by the manufacturer. The FDA will work with
all stakeholders to help facilitate the continued availability of naloxone nasal spray products during
Narcan's transition from prescription to OTC status, which may take months. The FDA hosted a
stakeholder call to share information on expanding access to naloxone on March 30, 2023. lick here
