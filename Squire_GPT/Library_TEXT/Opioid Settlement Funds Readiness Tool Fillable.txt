Part 1 - Develop a Coordinated and Transparent Process

Settlement funds will be available for at least 18 years. is essential to build an organized, transparent, and sustainable process for how funds will be
“located, Use the checklist below to integrate these planning steps into your process:

Review local data: We have looked at our lca dots using the CDPH
dashboard to prioritize funding towards our highest need communities.
For example, some counties have disproportionate overdose rates within
specific 2p codes and among ther black and tral communities. Local
health departments and/or coalitions can provide these analyses, including
data from ODMAP to monitor zipcodes with spikes in overdose rates.
Based on the data, these ae priortiesin terms of location and
demographics:

Prirty populaton/region 1

Prirty population/region 2;

Prirty population/region 3

urpose: We have outlined our averll vision and
purpose for our opioid settlement funds. Articulating a specific vision
Eatemant builds a comman focus and commitment among partners. tis
also an opportunity to align opioid settlement funds with other local
initiatives and funding steams dadieated to substance use prevention and

Build partnerships (see part 2}: We have a plan for conducting
‘outreach to local leaders and organizations doing exiting work around
substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery to build a cohesive
funding strategy. Ths includes local coalitions, publichealth departments,
behavioral haath departments, harm reduction organizations, and
addiction treatment providers. As apart of this step, itis important to
‘acknowledge any potential turf issues and challenges between local
partners and take time to build wust

Determine structure for decision-making and communications:
have established a witten process and structure for how opioid setlement
funds willbe allocated, This includes documentation of who makes
decisions, how decisions are made, and how those decisions are
communicated externally.

Conduct an “equity check": We have identified a process to ensure
that allocation of funds supports local organizations and interventions that
serve those most impacted by addiction and overdose. This includes
directly engaging those with ved and living experience and local laaders
