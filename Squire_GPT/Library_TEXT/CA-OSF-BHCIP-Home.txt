Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructure
Program

Overview

The Department of Health Care Services (OHCS) was authorized through 2021 legislation

(httns/Mleginfo legislature ca gov/faces/codes. displayTextshtm|?
lawCode=WiCéidivision=5 title= &part=7.fichapter= LAiarticle=) to establish the Behavioral Health
Continuum Infrastructure Program (8HCIP) with $2.2 billion to construct, acquire, and rehabilitate
real estate assets or to invest in needed mobile crisis infrastructure to expand the community
continuum of behavioral health treatment resources. DHCS is releasing BHCIP grant funds through
six rounds that target various gaps in the state's behavioral health facility infrastructure. For more
information on BHCIP grant funding and awards, please visit the BHCIP website

Background

The Department aims to reduce homelessness, incarceration, unnecessary hospitalizations, and
inpatient days and improve outcomes for people with behavioral health conditions by expanding
access to community-based treatment. The Department proposes to invest in the expansion of beds,
Units, or rooms by building new behavioral health continuum infrastructure and expanding capacity.
These resources would expand the continuum of services by increasing capacity for short-term crisis
stabilization, acute and sub-acute care, crisis residential, community-based mental health residential
‘treatment, substance use disorder residential treatment, peer respite, mobile crisis, community and
outpatient behavioral health services, and other clinically enriched longer-term treatment and
rehabilitation opportunities for individuals with behavioral health disorders, in the least restrictive

and least costly setting,
