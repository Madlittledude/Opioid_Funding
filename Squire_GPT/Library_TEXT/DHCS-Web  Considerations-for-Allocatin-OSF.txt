Opioid Settlements Oversight Entity: DHCS

» The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) is tasked with overseeing
Participating Subdivisions that receive funds from the opioid settlements
with Janssen, the Distributors, Teva, Allergan and the Pharmacies.

» DHCS oversight responsibilities include:
* Monitoring the California Participating Subdivisions for compliance;
* Designating additional high-impact abatement activities;
* Conducting related stakeholder engagement; and

* Preparing annual reports.

_Page: 11

Annual Reporting

There is significant public interest in the use of opioid settlement funds:

» Kaiser Health News, March 30, 2023: $50 Billion in Opioid Settlement Cash Is on the
Way. We're Tracking How It's Spent.

Per the California State Agreements, DHCS will prepare an annual written report
regarding the State's use of funds from the settlements until those funds are fully
expended and for one year thereafter. These reports will be made publicly available on
the DHCS web site.

The DHCS report will include information about spending from the Participating
Subdivisions receiving funds from the CA Abatements Account, including allowable and
unallowable uses of funds.

Opioid Settlement Funds
are for Opioid Remediation

» The settlement agreements define opioid remediation as “care, treatment,
and other programs and expenditures ... designed to:

a) address the misuse and abuse of opioid products,
b) treat or mitigate opioid use or related disorders, and

c) mitigate other alleged effects of, including on those injured as a result
of, the opioid epidemic.”

_Page: 15

Exhibit E of the
National Settlement Agreements

» Opioid remediation activities are listed in Exhibit E of the national
settlement agreements.

» Exhibit E is included in all five of the settlements and is broken into
Schedule A (Core Strategies) and Schedule B (Approved Uses). Schedule B
is a longer list of many types of opioid remediation activities, while
Schedule A is a shorter list of core strategies that should be prioritized.

For a list of allowable activities, please refer to the Opioid Settlement Allowable Expenditures.


_Page: 16

California’s High Impact
Abatement Activities

» In addition to the opioid remediation activities outlined within Exhibit E,
California has designated a set of five High Impact Abatement Activities
(HIAA).

» No less than fifty percent (50%) of the funds received by a California
Participating Subdivision from the Abatement Accounts Fund in each
calendar year must be used for one or more of the HIAA.

» Many activities outlined within Exhibit E can qualify as HIAA depending on
their focus.

_Page: 17

California’s High Impact
Abatement Activities

No.

1 | Provision of matching funds or operating costs for substance use disorder facilities
with an approved project within the Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructure
Program (BHCIP)

2 | Creating new or expanded substance use disorder (SUD) treatment infrastructure

3 | Addressing the needs of communities of color and vulnerable populations (including
sheltered and unsheltered homeless populations) that are disproportionately
impacted by SUD

4 | Diversion of people with SUD from the justice system into treatment, including by
providing training and resources to first and early responders (sworn and non-sworn)
and implementing best practices for outreach, diversion and deflection,
employability, restorative justice, and harm reduction

5__| Interventions to prevent drug addiction in vulnerable youth


_Page: 18

New HIAA - Naloxone

» DHCS may add to the list of HIAA but may not delete from it. To add new
HIAA, DHCS is required to make reasonable efforts to consult with
Participating Subdivisions.

» DHCS polled Participating Subdivisions during a webinar on January 26,
2022, on whether to add a new HIAA for the purchase of naloxone. During
the poll, 91% responded in affirmation of this decision.

» The new HIAA language is:

“The purchase of naloxone for distribution and efforts to expand access
to naloxone for opioid overdose reversals.”

Poll Question

» Has your Subdivision engaged in a community planning
process for the use of opioid settlement funds?

» In the chat, provide any information you'd like to share about
your Subdivision’s process for allocating opioid settlement
funds.

_Page: 21

Funding Flexibilities

» Settlement allocations and expenditures will need to be tracked separately
and reported to DHCS during reporting periods.

» Participating Subdivisions may choose to:
* Opt out of direct payments;

+ Transfer their payments to another Participating Subdivision; and/or
+ Roll over or encumber funds to use later.

_Page: 22

Opting Out of Payments

» Participating Subdivisions that are cities can opt out of direct payment of
funds, which sends their allocation to the County in which the city is
located.

» Cities which have opted-out of direct payment do not need to report to
DHCS during reporting periods. Cities who choose not to elect direct
payment must notify the national settlement administrator, BrownGreer
PLC, at least 60 days prior to a payment date.

_Page: 23

Transferring to Other
Participating Subdivisions

» Participating Subdivisions may agree to reallocate their shares of the CA
Abatement Accounts Funds among themselves, provided that any direct
distribution may only be to another Participating Subdivision and the
receiving Participating Subdivision must agree to the share being
reallocated to them.

» Such transfers will need to be reported to DHCS during reporting periods,
including the amount of the transfer and the transferring and receiving
Participating Subdivisions.

_Page: 24

Rolling Over/Encumbering Funds

» Participating Subdivisions may roll over funds from the previous year
and/or encumber funds for future eligible purchases. Funds must be
expended or encumbered within five (5) years of receipt, or seven (7) years
for capital outlay projects.

» For example, funds received during 2022 must be spent or encumbered
by 2027 (five (5) years) for non-capital outlay projects or 2029 (seven (7)
years) for capital outlay projects. Funds not expended or encumbered
within these timeframes must be returned to the state.

_Page: 25

Best Practices for Allocating Funds

» When allocating funds, Participating Subdivisions should consider:

+ Investing in evidence-based practices with a focus on those listed in
California's HIAA and the Core Strategies (Schedule A) of Exhibit E.

* Supplementing current successful efforts.

* Creating a transparent process for planning, including engaging people
with lived experience and people working in SUD prevention,
treatment, harm reduction and recovery to understand community
needs.

_Page: 26

Prioritize Core Strategies and HIAA

» Prioritize strategies listed in Schedule A “Core Strategies” of Exhibit E.

+ Core Strategies can be found in Exhibit E and in the Allowable Expenses
resource.

+ Johns Hopkins School of Public Health has created a resource with more
information on evidence-based programs that fit within the Core Strategies.

» Ensure that at least 50% of funds are spent on High Impact Abatement Activities.

* Many activities outlined within Exhibit E can qualify as HIAA depending on
their focus.

_Page: 27

Evidence-Based Strategies

» There is a substantial body of evidence demonstrating successful
interventions for opioid use disorder. Participating Subdivisions should
use this information to make funding decisions.

+ For example, Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) are proven to increase
retention in treatment and reduce the risk of overdose. Strategies for treatment
should include organizations or treatment providers that provide or endorse the use
of MOUD.

» Below are resources that can help identify evidence-based strategies:
+ Evidence-Based Strategies for the Abatement of Harms from the Opioid Epidemic
+ SAMHSA Evidence-Based Practices Resource Center


_Page: 28

Funding Current Efforts

Use funds to supplement current efforts in your community. Rather than creating
new programs or supplanting efforts, look for organizations already doing opioid
remediation work in your jurisdiction. Connect with them to learn about their needs.

Local entities who are likely working on this include:
* County Public Health Departments
* County Behavioral Health Departments
» Harm Reduction Programs/Syringe Service Programs
* Local Opioid Coalitions
* Local SUD Treatment Providers
* Local Hospitals and Clinics

_Page: 29

County Public and Behavioral Health

» Connect with your public health and/or behavioral health department and
discuss which current programs can benefit from opioid settlement funds.

+ County Behavioral Health Department Directory

* County Public Health Department Director


_Page: 30

County Behavioral Health Programs

» Many counties contract with, or directly provide substance use treatment
through county facilities. Connect with your county behavioral health
department to learn more.

» Opioid settlement funds can bolster county programs that DHCS is
already funding through the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment
Block Grant. This includes:

Local Harm Reduction Programs

There are currently 68 authorized syringe services programs (SSPs) statewide that
work directly with people who are currently using drugs and are at greatest risk of
overdose.

To find a local program visit this SSP Directory.

SSPs provide, among other things, the following Exhibit E activities:

* Naloxone distribution and training

» Access to sterile syringes and other harm reduction supplies

» Warm hand-offs to trusted community services, including treatment

Many also provide medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD).

Local Overdose Safety Coalitions

Over 50 local coalitions provide community outreach, overdose awareness and
education, and naloxone distribution and training for people who use drugs,
adults, youth, parents.

Coalitions provide nuanced approaches in communities to address overdose
prevention, given the diverse makeup of local communities.

Coalitions build strategic, multi-sector community partnerships that including
schools, law enforcement, jails/probation, clinics, treatment centers, harm
reduction, youth organizations, and families/loved ones of people who have died
from overdose.

Have a Transparent Process

Invite individuals with lived experience to participate in planning discussions, and/or
allocate a set number of seats on planning councils for individuals with lived experience.

Seek out input from a wide variety of groups during planning, including experts in SUD
treatment, organizations working directly with youth and people who use drugs, law
enforcement personnel, recovery community organizations, and social service
organizations.

+ In addition, include any city or county departments who may provide services in
accordance with the opioid remediation activities outlined in Exhibit E and California's
HIAA.

Solicit input from the public to help raise the profile of the plans and give those
community members with unique perspectives the opportunity to provide feedback.

_Page: 38

Exhibit E & Law Enforcement

» Exhibit E Law Enforcement Activities fall into the below categories, all of
which must focus on opioid remediation:
+» Education/training for first responders related to opioids
+ Diversion activities
» Warm handoff/overdose response
* Naloxone purchase/distribution
* Treatment within corrections or transitioning into the community
* Drug takeback/disposal

+» Wellness for first responders (must be specifically related to opioid
response)

_Page: 39

California's HIAA #4

» Diversion of people with SUD from the justice system into treatment,
including by providing training and resources to first and early responders
(sworn and non-sworn) and implementing best practices for outreach,
diversion and deflection, employability, restorative justice, and harm
reduction.

_Page: 40

What is Diversion?

» Diversion is a term used to describe intervention approaches that redirect individuals
with a SUD away from formal processing in criminal justice settings and into treatment,
recovery, and/or other support services. Diversion strategies include pre-arrest, pre-
arraignment, and pre-trial activities aimed at directing an individual towards a treatment

or care program as an alternative to imprisonment.
